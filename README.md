## üí° Example Interactions with Cursor Agent

### Personal Challenges
**You:** "I'm having trouble with my teenage daughter - she's rebelling and we argue constantly."

**Agent Response:** 
*Drawing from Ethics of the Fathers...*

**Wisdom from the Fathers:**
Hillel teaches: "Do not judge your fellow until you have stood in his place." (Chapter 2, Verse 5)

Also: "Be of the disciples of Aaron‚Äîlove peace and pursue peace, love people and draw them close to Torah." (Chapter 1, Verse 12)

**Guidance for You:**
Try to understand what your daughter is experiencing. Teenage years bring identity struggles and desire for independence. Instead of winning arguments, focus on maintaining connection. Show interest in her world, validate her feelings even when you disagree with her choices...

*[Agent saves this Q&A to generated-qa.md for future reference]*

### Work Situations
**You:** "My boss takes credit for my work. How should I respond?"

**Agent Response:**
*References teachings about justice, humility, and focusing on character rather than recognition...*

### Relationship Issues
**You:** "I said something hurtful to my friend. How do I repair this?"

**Agent Response:**
*Draws from teachings about peace, humility, and taking responsibility...*
