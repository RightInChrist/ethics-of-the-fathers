My dear friend, I understand your heart deeply. As a husband, father, and Discord administrator, you carry the weight of responsibility for guiding others—yet you face the frustration of youth who cannot yet see what experience has taught you. This is one of the most ancient challenges of wisdom and leadership.

Let me share with you what our fathers teach us about this very situation:

## **The Challenge of Unready Students**

**From Chapter 2, Verse 6:** "A short-tempered person cannot teach." Hillel reminds us that anger—even righteous frustration—blocks our ability to effectively guide others. When we're frustrated with their immaturity, we lose our teaching power.

**From Chapter 5, Verse 11:** The sages categorize four types of temperaments. The ideal teacher is "Hard to become angry and easy to be appeased: a pious person." This is the temperament that can handle challenging students without losing effectiveness.

## **The Wisdom of Timing and Patience**

**From Chapter 4, Verse 18:** "Do not try to appease your friend during his hour of anger; Nor comfort him at the hour while his dead still lies before him... Nor strive to see him in the hour of his disgrace."

Sometimes people—especially the young—are simply not ready to receive wisdom. Attempting to force insight when they're in their "hour" of certainty or immaturity often backfires.

## **Your Approach as a Wise Leader**

**From Chapter 4, Verse 1:** "Who is wise? One who learns from every person." Even as you try to teach them, remember that these young people may have insights you don't yet possess. This attitude of humility will make them more receptive.

**From Chapter 1, Verse 12:** "Be of the disciples of Aaron—love peace and pursue peace, love people and draw them close to Torah." Aaron's method was to love people first, then gradually draw them toward wisdom. Your frustration, though understandable, may be pushing them away from the very wisdom you want to share.

## **Practical Guidance for Your Situation**

1. **Model Rather Than Lecture:** Your example of asking trusted others to teach you shows exactly the right approach. Continue demonstrating intellectual humility while maintaining your authority.

2. **Plant Seeds Subtly:** Instead of direct confrontation about their views, ask gentle questions that might lead them to discover limitations in their thinking themselves.

3. **Find Common Ground:** The young Jew and Muslim likely share more values than they realize. Help them see their commonalities rather than focusing on their differences.

4. **Use Time as Your Ally:** **From Chapter 4, Verse 3:** "There is no person who does not have his hour." These young people will have their moments of readiness. Your job is to be prepared when those moments come.

## **Remember Your Own Journey**

You mentioned they remind you of your past self. **From Chapter 2, Verse 5:** "Do not judge your fellow until you have stood in his place." You've been where they are—remember how you eventually learned. What helped you mature? Was it lectures from elders, or experience and gentle guidance?

**From Chapter 3, Verse 14:** Every person has their place and purpose. Their current immaturity may be exactly what they need to go through to develop true wisdom.

## **Your True Victory**

Your greatest accomplishment may not be changing their minds today, but creating an environment where they can eventually grow. You've already shown wisdom by:
- Maintaining your own humility
- Continuing to learn from others
- Not forcing confrontation
- Staying present in their community

This is the path of Aaron—loving peace, pursuing peace, and drawing people gradually toward wisdom through relationship rather than force.

*The young saplings may not yet appreciate the shade of the old oak, but the oak continues to grow and provide shelter, knowing that one day they too will understand what it means to offer protection to those who cannot yet protect themselves.*
