# Ethics of the Fathers: Chapter Six

## Verse 1

**The sages taught in the language of the Mishnah. Blessed be He who chose them and their teaching. Rabbi Meir said: Whoever occupies himself with the Torah for its own sake, merits many things; not only that but he is worth the whole world. He is called beloved friend; one that loves God; one that loves humankind; one that gladdens God; one that gladdens humankind. And the Torah clothes him in humility and reverence, and equips him to be righteous, pious, upright and trustworthy; it keeps him far from sin, and brings him near to merit. And people benefit from his counsel, sound knowledge, understanding and strength, as it is said, "Counsel is mine and sound wisdom; I am understanding, strength is mine" (Proverbs 8:14). And it bestows upon him royalty, dominion, and acuteness in judgment. To him are revealed the secrets of the Torah, and he is made as an ever-flowing spring, and like a stream that never ceases. And he becomes modest, long-suffering and forgiving of insult. And it magnifies him and exalts him over everything.**

The transformative power of Torah study:
- **For its own sake** - Pure motivation, not for personal gain
- **Universal value** - Worth the whole world
- **Divine friendship** - Beloved by God and humanity
- **Character development** - Humility, righteousness, trustworthiness
- **Practical benefits** - Wisdom, counsel, understanding
- **Spiritual elevation** - Royalty, judgment, revealed secrets
- **Endless growth** - Like an ever-flowing spring

## Verse 2

**Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said: every day a bat kol (a heavenly voice) goes forth from Mount Horeb and makes proclamation and says: "Woe unto humankind for their contempt towards the Torah", for whoever does not occupy himself with the study of Torah is called nazuf (the rebuked). As it is said, "Like a gold ring in the snout of a pig is a beautiful woman bereft of sense" (Proverbs 11:22). And it says, "And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tablets" (Exodus 32:16). Read not haruth ['graven'] but heruth ['freedom']. For there is no free man but one that occupies himself with the study of the Torah. And whoever regularly occupies himself with the study of the Torah he is surely exalted, as it is said, "And from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and Nahaliel to Bamoth" (Numbers 21:19).**

The daily divine call:
- **Heavenly voice daily** - Constant divine invitation to study
- **Mount Horeb** - Where Torah was given
- **Contempt brings woe** - Neglecting Torah has consequences
- **Beauty without wisdom** - Like gold ring in pig's snout
- **True freedom** - Only through Torah study
- **Progressive elevation** - Mattanah (gift) to Nahaliel (inheritance of God) to Bamoth (heights)

## Verse 3

**One who learns from his fellow one chapter, or one halakhah, or one verse, or one word, or even one letter, is obligated to treat him with honor; for so we find with David, king of Israel, who learned from Ahitophel no more than two things, yet called him his master, his guide and his beloved friend, as it is said, "But it was you, a man mine equal, my guide and my beloved friend" (Psalms 55:14). Is this not [an instance of the argument] "from the less to the greater" (kal vehomer)? If David, king of Israel who learned from Ahitophel no more than two things, nevertheless called him his master, his guide and his beloved friend; then in the case of one who learns from his fellow one chapter, or one halakhah, or one verse, or one word, or even one letter, all the more so he is under obligation to treat him with honor. And "honor" means nothing but Torah, as it is said, "It is honor that sages inherit" (Proverbs 3:35). "And the perfect shall inherit good" (Proverbs 28:10), and "good" means nothing but Torah, as it is said, "For I give you good instruction; do not forsake my Torah" (Proverbs 4:2).**

Gratitude to teachers:
- **Any amount of learning** - Even one letter creates obligation
- **King David's example** - Even a king honored his teacher
- **Ahitophel's betrayal** - Despite later betrayal, David acknowledged the teaching
- **Logical argument** - If a king honors teachers, how much more should we
- **Honor equals Torah** - The highest honor is associated with wisdom
- **Good equals Torah** - The ultimate good is divine teaching

## Verse 4

**Such is the way [of a life] of Torah: you shall eat bread with salt, and rationed water shall you drink; you shall sleep on the ground, your life will be one of privation, and in Torah shall you labor. If you do this, "Happy shall you be and it shall be good for you" (Psalms 128:2): "Happy shall you be" in this world, "and it shall be good for you" in the world to come.**

The ascetic path of Torah:
- **Simple sustenance** - Bread with salt, rationed water
- **Minimal comfort** - Sleep on the ground
- **Life of privation** - Material sacrifice for spiritual gain
- **Labor in Torah** - Intensive study and practice
- **Dual reward** - Happiness in this world, goodness in the next

## Verse 5

**Do not seek greatness for yourself, and do not covet honor. Practice more than you learn. Do not yearn for the table of kings, for your table is greater than their table, and your crown is greater than their crown, and faithful is your employer to pay you the reward of your labor.**

Rejecting worldly ambition:
- **Avoid seeking greatness** - Don't pursue status
- **Don't covet honor** - Resist the desire for recognition
- **Practice over learning** - Implementation matters more than knowledge
- **Spiritual superiority** - Your humble table surpasses royal feasts
- **Divine employment** - God is the most faithful employer

## Verse 6

**Greater is learning Torah than the priesthood and than royalty, for royalty is acquired by thirty stages, and the priesthood by twenty-four, but the Torah by forty-eight things. By study, attentive listening, proper speech, by an understanding heart, by an intelligent heart, by awe, by fear, by humility, by joy, by attending to the sages, by critical give and take with friends, by fine argumentation with disciples, by clear thinking, by study of Scripture, by study of Mishnah, by a minimum of sleep, by a minimum of chatter, by a minimum of pleasure, by a minimum of frivolity, by a minimum of preoccupation with worldly matters, by long-suffering, by generosity, by faith in the sages, by acceptance of suffering. [Learning of Torah is also acquired by one] who recognizes his place, who rejoices in his portion, who makes a fence about his words, who takes no credit for himself, who is loved, who loves God, who loves [his fellow] creatures, who loves righteous ways, who loves reproof, who loves uprightness, who keeps himself far from honors, who does not let his heart become swelled on account of his learning, who does not delight in giving legal decisions, who shares in the bearing of a burden with his colleague, who judges with the scales weighted in his favor, who leads him on to truth, who leads him on to peace, who composes himself at his study, who asks and answers, who listens [to others], and [himself] adds [to his knowledge], who learns in order to teach, who learns in order to practice, who makes his teacher wiser, who is exact in what he has learned, and who says a thing in the name of him who said it. Thus you have learned: everyone who says a thing in the name of him who said it, brings deliverance into the world, as it is said: "And Esther told the king in Mordecai's name" (Esther 2:22).**

The forty-eight ways to acquire Torah:
**Intellectual qualities:**
1. Study 2. Attentive listening 3. Proper speech 4. Understanding heart 5. Intelligent heart 6. Clear thinking 7. Study of Scripture 8. Study of Mishnah

**Character traits:**

**Attribution brings deliverance** - Giving credit where due brings redemption

## Verse 7

**Great is Torah for it gives life to those that practice it, in this world, and in the world to come, as it is said: "For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh" (Proverbs 4:22), And it says: "It will be a cure for your navel and marrow for your bones" (ibid. 3:8) And it says: "She is a tree of life to those that grasp her, and whoever holds onto her is happy" (ibid. 3:18), And it says: "For they are a graceful wreath upon your head, a necklace about your throat" (ibid. 1:9), And it says: "She will adorn your head with a graceful wreath; crown you with a glorious diadem" (ibid. 4:9) And it says: "In her right hand is length of days, in her left riches and honor" (ibid. 3:16), And it says: "For they will bestow on you length of days, years of life and peace" (ibid. 3:2).**

Torah as life force:
- **Life in both worlds** - Benefits here and in eternity
- **Physical health** - "Health to all their flesh"
- **Spiritual healing** - "Cure for your navel and marrow"
- **Tree of life** - Eternal growth and vitality
- **Beauty and dignity** - Graceful wreath, glorious crown
- **Complete blessing** - Length of days, riches, honor, peace

## Verse 8

**Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai: Beauty, strength, riches, honor, wisdom, [old age], gray hair, and children are becoming to the righteous, and becoming to the world, as it is said: "Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is attained by way of righteousness" (Proverbs 16:31), And it says: "The ornament of the wise is their wealth" (ibid. 14:24), And it says: "Grandchildren are the glory of their elders, and the glory of children is their parents" (ibid. 17:6), And it says: "The glory of youths is their strength; and the beauty of old men is their gray hair" (ibid. 20:29), And it says: "Then the moon shall be ashamed, and the sun shall be abashed. For the Lord of Hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and God's Honor will be revealed to his elders" (Isaiah 24:23). Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya said: these seven qualities, which the sages have listed [as becoming] to the righteous, were all of them fulfilled in Rabbi and his sons.**

Blessings suited to the righteous:
- **Seven qualities** - Beauty, strength, riches, honor, wisdom, old age, children
- **Becoming to righteous** - These blessings suit those who deserve them
- **Beneficial to world** - When righteous have these, society benefits
- **Gray hair as crown** - Old age becomes glory through righteousness
- **Wealth as ornament** - Riches beautify the wise
- **Intergenerational glory** - Children and parents honor each other
- **Rabbi's fulfillment** - Rabbi Judah HaNasi embodied all seven

## Verse 9

**Rabbi Yose ben Kisma said: Once I was walking by the way when a man met me, and greeted me and I greeted him. He said to me, "Rabbi, where are you from?" I said to him, "I am from a great city of sages and scribes". He said to me, "Rabbi, would you consider living with us in our place? I would give you a thousand thousand denarii of gold, and precious stones and pearls." I said to him: "My son, even if you were to give me all the silver and gold, precious stones and pearls that are in the world, I would not dwell anywhere except in a place of Torah; for when a man passes away there accompany him neither gold nor silver, nor precious stones nor pearls, but Torah and good deeds alone, as it is said, 'When you walk it will lead you. When you lie down it will watch over you; and when you are awake it will talk with you' (Proverbs 6:22). 'When you walk it will lead you' in this world. 'When you lie down it will watch over you' in the grave; 'And when you are awake it will talk with you' in the world to come." And thus it is written in the book of Psalms by David, king of Israel, "I prefer the teaching You proclaimed to thousands of pieces of gold and silver" (Psalms 119:72), And it says: "Mine is the silver, and mine the gold, says the Lord of Hosts" (Haggai 2:8).**

Choosing wisdom over wealth:
- **Incredible offer** - Vast wealth in exchange for relocation
- **Firm refusal** - "I would not dwell anywhere except in a place of Torah"
- **Death's revelation** - Only Torah and good deeds accompany us beyond
- **Three stages of benefit:**
  - This world - Torah guides you while walking
  - Grave - Torah watches over you while lying down
  - World to come - Torah speaks with you when awake
- **David's preference** - Teaching over thousands of gold and silver
- **Divine ownership** - All wealth ultimately belongs to God

## Verse 10

**Five possessions did the Holy Blessed One, set aside as his own in this world, and these are they: The Torah, one possession; Heaven and earth, another possession; Abraham, another possession; Israel, another possession; The Temple, another possession.**

**1a) The Torah is one possession. From where do we know this? Since it is written, "The Lord possessed (usually translated as 'created') me at the beginning of his course, at the first of His works of old" (Proverbs 8:22).**

**2a) Heaven and earth, another possession. From where do we know this? Since it is said: "Thus said the Lord: The heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool; Where could you build a house for Me, What place could serve as My abode?" (Isaiah 66:1) And it says: "How many are the things You have made, O Lord; You have made them all with wisdom; the earth is full of Your possessions" (Psalms 104:24).**

**3a) Abraham is another possession. From where do we know this? Since it is written: "He blessed him, saying, 'Blessed by Abram of God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth'" (Genesis 14:19).**

**4a) Israel is another possession. From where do we know this? Since it is written: "Till Your people cross over, O Lord, Till Your people whom You have possessed" (Exodus 15:16). And it says: "As to the holy and mighty ones that are in the land, my whole desire (possession) is in them" (Psalms 16:3).**

**5a) The Temple is another possession. From where do we know this? Since it is said: "The sanctuary, O lord, which your hands have established" (Exodus 15:17), And it says: "And He brought them to His holy realm, to the mountain, which His right hand had possessed" (Psalms 78:54).**

God's five special possessions:
- **Torah** - Divine wisdom and instruction
- **Heaven and earth** - The entire universe
- **Abraham** - The first believer and father of faith
- **Israel** - The chosen people
- **The Temple** - The dwelling place of divine presence

Each has biblical proof texts showing God's special relationship with these entities.

## Verse 11

**Whatever the Holy Blessed One created in His world, he created only for His glory, as it is said: "All who are linked to My name, whom I have created, formed and made for My glory" (Isaiah 43:7), And it says: "The Lord shall reign for ever and ever" (Exodus 15:18).**

Ultimate purpose of creation:
- **Everything for God's glory** - The entire universe serves this purpose
- **Three stages of creation** - Created, formed, made
- **Eternal divine reign** - God's sovereignty never ends

## Concluding Prayer

**After reciting Pirkei Avot**
**Said Rabbi Chanania ben Akashya: It pleased the Holy Blessed One to grant merit to Israel, that is why He gave them Torah and commandments in abundance, as it is said, "The Lord was pleased for His righteousness, to make Torah great and glorious" (Isaiah 42:21).**

The abundance of divine law:
- **Divine pleasure** - God wanted to give Israel merit
- **Abundant opportunities** - Many commandments provide many chances for good deeds
- **Torah's greatness** - The abundance itself glorifies the teaching
- **Divine righteousness** - God's justice expressed through giving opportunities for merit

*Chapter Six emphasizes the supreme value of Torah study, the proper methods for acquiring wisdom, the transformative power of learning, and concludes with God's five special possessions and the ultimate purpose of creation for divine glory.*
