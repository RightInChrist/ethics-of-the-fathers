# Ethics of the Fathers: Chapter Two

## Verse 1

**Rabbi [Judah the Prince] would say: Which is the proper path for man to choose for himself? Whatever is harmonious for the one who does it, and harmonious for mankind. Be as careful with a minor mitzvah as with a major one, for you do not know the reward given for the mitzvot. Consider the cost of a mitzvah against its reward, and the reward of a transgression against its cost. Contemplate three things and you will not come to the hands of transgression: Know what is above from you: a seeing eye, a hearing ear, and all your deeds being inscribed in a book.**

Key principles for ethical living:
- Choose paths that benefit both yourself and others
- Treat all commandments with equal care
- Consider long-term consequences of actions
- Remember that we are always being observed by the Divine

## Verse 2

**Rabban Gamliel the son of Rabbi Judah the Prince would say: Beautiful is the study of Torah with the way of the world, for the toil of them both causes sin to be forgotten. Ultimately, all Torah study that is not accompanied with work is destined to cease and to cause sin.**

The balance between spiritual and worldly pursuits:
- Torah study should be combined with earning a livelihood
- Both spiritual and practical work prevent sin
- Pure academic study without practical application is unsustainable

## Verse 3

**Be careful with the government, for they do not befriend a person except for their own needs. They appear as friends when it is beneficial to them, but they do not stand by a person in his time of distress.**

Warning about political power:
- Governments act primarily out of self-interest
- Political friendships are often temporary and conditional
- Don't rely on political connections in times of need

## Verse 4

**He [Rabban Gamliel] would also say: Do His will as though it were your will, so that He will do your will as though it were His will. Nullify your will before His will, so that He will nullify the will of others before your will.**

Aligning personal will with Divine will:
- When we truly want what G-d wants, our desires become aligned
- Submitting to Divine will can lead to our legitimate needs being fulfilled
- Selflessness can paradoxically lead to our own protection

## Verse 5

**Hillel would say: Do not separate yourself from the community. Do not trust in yourself until the day you die. Do not judge your fellow until you have stood in his place. Do not say something that cannot be understood in the belief that it will eventually be understood. And do not say "When I have time I will study," for perhaps you will not have time.**

Five principles from Hillel:
- Stay connected to your community
- Maintain humility throughout life
- Practice empathy before judging others
- Communicate clearly and directly
- Don't postpone learning and growth

## Verse 6

**He would also say: A boor cannot be sin-fearing, an ignorant person cannot be pious, a bashful one cannot learn, a short-tempered person cannot teach, nor does anyone who does much business grow wise. In a place where there are no men, strive to be a man.**

Character traits and their effects:
- Coarseness prevents proper reverence
- Ignorance prevents true piety
- Excessive shyness hinders learning
- Anger prevents effective teaching
- Excessive business focus prevents wisdom
- In absence of leadership, step up to lead

## Verse 7

**He saw a skull floating upon the water, and said to it: Because you drowned others, you were drowned; and those who drowned you, will eventually be drowned.**

The principle of measure for measure:
- Actions have consequences that often mirror the original deed
- Violence and harm tend to perpetuate cycles of violence
- Justice operates through natural consequences

## Verse 8

**He would also say: The more flesh, the more worms; the more possessions, the more worry; the more wives, the more witchcraft; the more maidservants, the more promiscuity; the more menservants, the more theft. The more Torah, the more life; the more study, the more wisdom; the more counsel, the more understanding; the more charity, the more peace. One who acquires a good name has acquired it for himself; one who acquires the words of Torah has acquired life in the World to Come.**

Contrasting material and spiritual acquisitions:
- Material excess leads to problems and complications
- Spiritual pursuits lead to positive growth and outcomes
- Torah and wisdom bring lasting benefits
- Good character benefits both this world and the next

## Verse 9

**Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai received the tradition from Hillel and Shammai. He would say: If you have learned much Torah, do not take credit for yourselfâ€”it is for this that you were created.**

Humility in learning:
- Knowledge should not lead to arrogance
- Learning Torah is fulfilling our essential purpose
- We should not seek personal credit for fulfilling our obligations

## Verses 10-16 - The Five Students

**Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai had five students, and these are they: Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, Rabbi Joshua ben Chananya, Rabbi Yose the Priest, Rabbi Shimon ben Netanel, and Rabbi Elazar ben Arach.**

Each student was known for particular qualities:

**Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus** - "A cemented cistern that loses not a drop" (perfect memory)
**Rabbi Joshua ben Chananya** - "Happy is she who gave birth to him" (exceptional character)
**Rabbi Yose the Priest** - "A pious person" (exceptional devotion)
**Rabbi Shimon ben Netanel** - "One who fears sin" (careful about transgression)
**Rabbi Elazar ben Arach** - "A spring that flows with increasing force" (creative wisdom)

## Verse 17

**He [Rabban Yochanan] would say to them: Go out and see which is the proper path to which a person should cling. Rabbi Eliezer said: A good eye. Rabbi Joshua said: A good friend. Rabbi Yose said: A good neighbor. Rabbi Shimon said: One who considers the outcome of his actions. Rabbi Elazar said: A good heart.**

Different approaches to ethical living:
- **Good eye** - Positive perspective and generosity
- **Good friend** - Quality relationships
- **Good neighbor** - Community harmony
- **Considering outcomes** - Thoughtful decision-making
- **Good heart** - Pure intentions and kindness

**Rabban Yochanan said to them: I prefer the words of Elazar ben Arach, for his words include all of your words.**

## Verse 18

**He said to them: Go out and see which is the bad path that a person should distance himself from. Rabbi Eliezer said: A bad eye. Rabbi Joshua said: A bad friend. Rabbi Yose said: A bad neighbor. Rabbi Shimon said: One who borrows and does not repay. Rabbi Elazar said: A bad heart.**

Corresponding negative traits to avoid:
- **Bad eye** - Jealousy and stinginess
- **Bad friend** - Harmful associations
- **Bad neighbor** - Community discord
- **Not repaying debts** - Dishonesty and ingratitude
- **Bad heart** - Malicious intentions

**Rabban Yochanan said to them: I prefer the words of Elazar ben Arach, for his words include all of your words.**
