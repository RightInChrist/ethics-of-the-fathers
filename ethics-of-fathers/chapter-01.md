# Ethics of the Fathers: Chapter One

## Introduction

All Israel have a share in the World To Come, as it is stated (Isaiah 60:21): 'And Your people are tzadikkim (righteous).' They shall inherit the land forever. They are the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, in which I take pride. (Sanhedrin 90a)

## Verse 1

**Moses received the Torah from Sinai and gave it over to Joshua. Joshua gave it over to the Elders, the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets gave it over to the Men of the Great Assembly. They [the Men of the Great Assembly] would always say these three things: Be cautious in judgement. Establish many pupils. And make a safety fence around the Torah.**

This opening verse establishes the chain of transmission of the oral tradition from Mount Sinai through the generations. The three fundamental principles are:
- **Be cautious in judgement** - Exercise careful deliberation before making decisions
- **Establish many pupils** - Spread knowledge and wisdom to others
- **Make a safety fence around the Torah** - Create protective measures to prevent transgression

## Verse 2

**Shimon the Righteous was among the last surviving members of the Great assembly. He would say: The world stands on three things: Torah, the service of G-d, and deeds of kindness.**

The three pillars that sustain the world:
- **Torah** - Study and knowledge of divine wisdom
- **Service of G-d** - Prayer and spiritual devotion
- **Deeds of kindness** - Acts of compassion and charity toward others

## Verse 3

**Antigonus of Socho received the tradition from Shimon the Righteous. He would say: Do not be like servants who serve their master for the sake of receiving a reward; rather, be like servants who serve their master not for the sake of receiving a reward. And let the awe of Heaven be upon you.**

This teaches us about the purity of intention in serving G-d - our service should be motivated by love and reverence, not by expectation of reward.

## Verse 4

**Yose ben Yoezer of Tzreidah and Yose ben Yochanan of Jerusalem received the tradition from them. Yose ben Yoezer would say: Let your house be a meeting place for the wise; dust yourself in the dust of their feet, and drink thirstily of their words.**

This emphasizes the importance of:
- Creating a home environment conducive to learning
- Humbling oneself before teachers and scholars
- Eagerly absorbing wisdom from learned individuals

## Verse 5

**Yose ben Yochanan of Jerusalem would say: Let your house be wide open, and let the poor be members of your household. Do not engage in excessive conversation with women. This is said even regarding one's own wife—how much more so regarding the wife of another. Hence the sages said: One who excessively converses with women causes evil to himself, neglects the study of Torah, and will eventually inherit Gehinnom.**

This teaches about:
- Hospitality and charity toward the poor
- The importance of proper conduct and focus on spiritual matters
- Avoiding idle conversation that distracts from meaningful pursuits

## Verse 6

**Joshua ben Perachyah and Nitai the Arbelite received from them. Joshua ben Perachyah would say: Provide for yourself a teacher, acquire for yourself a friend, and judge every person favorably.**

Three essential relationships for growth:
- **A teacher** - Someone to guide your learning and development
- **A friend** - A peer for mutual support and accountability
- **Judge favorably** - Give others the benefit of the doubt

## Verse 7

**Nitai the Arbelite would say: Distance yourself from a bad neighbor, do not become close to a wicked person, and do not despair of retribution.**

Guidance about relationships and justice:
- Avoid negative influences
- Don't associate closely with those of poor character
- Trust that justice will ultimately prevail

## Verse 8

**Judah ben Tabbai and Shimon ben Shatach received from them. Judah ben Tabbai would say: Do not act as a counselor-at-law when you sit in judgment; when the litigants stand before you, consider them both guilty, but when they leave your presence, having accepted the judgment, consider them both innocent.**

This teaches judicial ethics:
- Avoid bias when serving as a judge
- Maintain healthy skepticism during proceedings
- Show respect for all parties once judgment is rendered

## Verse 9

**Shimon ben Shatach would say: Interrogate the witnesses thoroughly, and be careful with your words, lest from them they learn to lie.**

Judicial wisdom about:
- The importance of thorough investigation
- Being careful not to lead witnesses toward false testimony
- The responsibility of those in authority for their words

## Verse 10

**Shemayah and Avtalyon received from them. Shemayah would say: Love work, hate positions of power, and do not become familiar with the government.**

Three principles for living:
- **Love work** - Find dignity and purpose in honest labor
- **Hate power** - Avoid seeking positions merely for their authority
- **Avoid government** - Be cautious about political entanglements

## Verse 11

**Avtalyon would say: Sages, be careful with your words, lest you become liable to the penalty of exile, and be exiled to a place of evil waters, and the disciples who follow you drink and die, and the Name of Heaven becomes desecrated.**

The responsibility of teachers:
- Words have power and consequence
- Teachers are responsible for their students' understanding
- Poor teaching can lead to spiritual harm
- The sanctification of G-d's name depends on proper instruction

## Verse 12

**Hillel and Shammai received from them. Hillel would say: Be of the disciples of Aaron—love peace and pursue peace, love people and draw them close to Torah.**

Hillel's approach to relationships:
- **Love peace** - Value harmony and seek it actively
- **Pursue peace** - Take initiative in creating peaceful relationships
- **Love people** - Have genuine care for all individuals
- **Draw them to Torah** - Help others connect with wisdom and truth

## Verse 13

**He [Hillel] would also say: One who aggrandizes his name destroys his name. One who does not increase, decreases. One who does not learn is liable to death. One who makes use of the crown passes away.**

Four teachings about personal development:
- Seeking honor for its own sake is self-defeating
- Spiritual and intellectual growth requires constant effort
- Neglecting learning leads to spiritual death
- Using Torah knowledge for personal gain is dangerous

## Verse 14

**He would also say: If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?**

Three fundamental questions about responsibility and action:
- **Personal responsibility** - Each person must take charge of their own development
- **Social responsibility** - We cannot live only for ourselves
- **Urgency** - The importance of acting in the present moment

## Verse 15

**Shammai would say: Make your Torah study a permanent fixture of your life. Say little and do much. And receive every person with a pleasant countenance.**

Shammai's three principles:
- **Consistent study** - Make learning a regular, non-negotiable part of life
- **Action over words** - Let deeds speak louder than promises
- **Pleasant demeanor** - Treat all people with warmth and respect
