# Ethics of the Fathers: Chapter Five

## Verse 1

**With ten utterances the world was created. And what does this teach, for surely it could have been created with one utterance? But this was so in order to punish the wicked who destroy the world that was created with ten utterances, and to give a good reward to the righteous who maintain the world that was created with ten utterances.**

The divine economy of creation:
- **Ten utterances created the world** - "And God said..." appears ten times in Genesis
- **Could have been one** - God's power is unlimited
- **Reward and punishment scaled** - Greater effort in creation = greater consequences
- **Righteous maintain creation** - Good deeds support the divine framework

## Verse 2

**[There were] ten generations from Adam to Noah, in order to make known what long-suffering is His; for all those generations kept on provoking Him, until He brought upon them the waters of the flood. [There were] ten generations from Noah to Abraham, in order to make known what long-suffering is His; for all those generations kept on provoking Him, until Abraham came and received the reward of all of them.**

Divine patience through history:
- **Adam to Noah** - Ten generations of corruption before the flood
- **Noah to Abraham** - Ten more generations before Abraham's righteousness
- **Divine patience** - God waits for righteousness to emerge
- **Abraham's merit** - One righteous person justifies many generations

## Verse 3

**With ten trials was Abraham, our father (may he rest in peace), tried, and he withstood them all; to make known how great was the love of Abraham, our father (peace be upon him).**

Abraham's tested faith:
- **Ten trials** - Various tests of faith and obedience
- **Withstood them all** - Complete faithfulness under pressure
- **Demonstrated love** - Trials revealed the depth of his devotion
- **Model for descendants** - Shows what faith can accomplish

## Verse 4

**Ten miracles were wrought for our ancestors in Egypt, and ten at the sea. Ten plagues did the Holy One, blessed be He, bring upon the Egyptians in Egypt and ten at the sea. [With] ten trials did our ancestors try God, blessed be He, as it is said, "and they have tried Me these ten times and they have not listened to my voice" (Numbers 14:22).**

The pattern of tens in the Exodus:
- **Ten miracles in Egypt** - Divine intervention on Israel's behalf
- **Ten miracles at the sea** - Continued protection during the crossing
- **Ten plagues on Egypt** - Divine judgment on the oppressors
- **Israel's ten trials of God** - Even after miracles, they complained

## Verse 5

**Ten wonders were wrought for our ancestors in the Temple: [1] no woman miscarried from the odor of the sacred flesh; [2] the sacred flesh never became putrid; [3] no fly was ever seen in the slaughterhouse; [4] no emission occurred to the high priest on the Day of Atonement; [5] the rains did not extinguish the fire of the woodpile; [6] the wind did not prevail against the column of smoke; [7] no defect was found in the omer, or in the two loaves, or in the showbread; [8] the people stood pressed together, yet bowed down and had room enough; [9] never did a serpent or a scorpion harm anyone in Jerusalem; [10] and no man said to his fellow: the place is too congested for me to lodge overnight in Jerusalem.**

Temple miracles - supernatural order:
- **Hygiene miracles** - No miscarriages, putrid meat, or flies
- **Priestly protection** - High priest maintained purity
- **Weather cooperation** - Rain and wind didn't interfere with worship
- **Agricultural perfection** - No defects in ritual offerings
- **Space miracles** - Room for everyone despite crowds
- **Safety guarantee** - No dangerous creatures in Jerusalem
- **Hospitality abundance** - Always room for pilgrims

## Verse 6

**Ten things were created on the eve of the Sabbath at twilight, and these are they: [1] the mouth of the earth, [2] the mouth of the well, [3] the mouth of the donkey, [4] the rainbow, [5] the manna, [6] the staff [of Moses], [7] the shamir, [8] the letters, [9] the writing, [10] and the tablets. And some say: also the demons, the grave of Moses, and the ram of Abraham, our father. And some say: and also tongs, made with tongs.**

Pre-planned miracles:
- **Eve of Sabbath creation** - Supernatural elements prepared from the beginning
- **Mouth of the earth** - Swallowed Korah's rebellion
- **Mouth of the well** - Miriam's well in the desert
- **Mouth of the donkey** - Balaam's talking donkey
- **Rainbow** - Sign of God's covenant after the flood
- **Manna** - Heavenly bread in the wilderness
- **Moses' staff** - Instrument of miracles
- **The shamir** - Worm that cut stones for the Temple
- **Letters and writing** - Divine communication tools
- **The tablets** - Ten Commandments

## Verse 7

**[There are] seven things [characteristic] in a clod, and seven in a wise man: A wise man does not speak before one who is greater than he in wisdom, and does not break into his fellow's speech; and is not hasty to answer; he asks what is relevant, and he answers to the point; and he speaks of the first [point] first, and of the last [point] last; and concerning that which he has not heard, he says: I have not heard; and he acknowledges the truth. And the reverse of these [are characteristic] in a clod.**

Wisdom vs. foolishness - seven contrasts:
- **Deference to greater wisdom** - vs. arrogant interruption
- **Respectful listening** - vs. breaking into others' speech
- **Thoughtful response** - vs. hasty answers
- **Relevant questions** - vs. irrelevant inquiries
- **Organized thinking** - vs. confused presentation
- **Honest ignorance** - vs. pretending to know
- **Acknowledging truth** - vs. stubborn denial

## Verse 8

**Seven kinds of punishment come to the world for seven categories of transgression: When some of them give tithes, and others do not give tithes, a famine from drought comesâ€”some go hungry, and others are satisfied. When they have all decided not to give tithes, a famine from tumult and drought comes; [When they have, in addition, decided] not to set apart the dough-offering, an all-consuming famine comes. Pestilence comes to the world for sins punishable by death according to the Torah, but which have not been referred to the court, and for neglect of the law regarding the fruits of the sabbatical year. The sword comes to the world for the delay of judgment, and for the perversion of judgment, and because of those who teach the Torah not in accordance with the accepted law.**

Collective consequences:
- **Partial tithing** - Partial drought affects some
- **Complete neglect of tithes** - Severe famine
- **Neglecting dough-offering** - All-consuming famine
- **Unpunished capital crimes** - Pestilence
- **Delayed/perverted justice** - War and violence
- **Teaching false Torah** - Contributes to societal breakdown

## Verse 9

**Wild beasts come to the world for swearing in vain, and for the profanation of the Name. Exile comes to the world for idolatry, for sexual sins and for bloodshed, and for [transgressing the commandment of] the [year of the] release of the land. At four times pestilence increases: in the fourth year, in the seventh year and at the conclusion of the seventh year, and at the conclusion of the Feast [of Tabernacles] in every year. In the fourth year, on account of the tithe of the poor which is due in the third year. In the seventh year, on account of the tithe of the poor which is due in the sixth year; At the conclusion of the seventh year, on account of the produce of the seventh year; And at the conclusion of the Feast [of Tabernacles] in every year, for robbing the gifts to the poor.**

More collective consequences:
- **Wild beasts** - Result of false oaths and blasphemy
- **Exile** - Ultimate punishment for the three cardinal sins plus sabbatical violations
- **Scheduled pestilence** - Predictable times when neglect of charity brings disease
- **Timing matters** - Specific violations bring consequences at specific times

## Verse 10

**There are four types of character in human beings: One that says: "mine is mine, and yours is yours": this is a commonplace type; and some say this is a sodom-type of character. [One that says:] "mine is yours and yours is mine": is an unlearned person (am haaretz); [One that says:] "mine is yours and yours is yours" is a pious person. [One that says:] "mine is mine, and yours is mine" is a wicked person.**

Four attitudes toward property:
- **"Mine is mine, yours is yours"** - Either normal or selfish (like Sodom)
- **"Mine is yours, yours is mine"** - Confused/communist mentality
- **"Mine is yours, yours is yours"** - Generous/pious person
- **"Mine is mine, yours is mine"** - Greedy/wicked person

## Verse 11

**There are four kinds of temperaments: Easy to become angry, and easy to be appeased: his gain disappears in his loss; Hard to become angry, and hard to be appeased: his loss disappears in his gain; Hard to become angry and easy to be appeased: a pious person; Easy to become angry and hard to be appeased: a wicked person.**

Four anger patterns:
- **Quick anger, quick forgiveness** - Neutral (cancels out)
- **Slow anger, slow forgiveness** - Also neutral (cancels out)
- **Slow anger, quick forgiveness** - Ideal/pious temperament
- **Quick anger, slow forgiveness** - Worst/wicked temperament

## Verse 12

**There are four types of disciples: Quick to comprehend, and quick to forget: his gain disappears in his loss; Slow to comprehend, and slow to forget: his loss disappears in his gain; Quick to comprehend, and slow to forget: he is a wise man; Slow to comprehend, and quick to forget, this is an evil portion.**

Four learning patterns:
- **Quick learning, quick forgetting** - Neutral (cancels out)
- **Slow learning, slow forgetting** - Also neutral (cancels out)
- **Quick learning, slow forgetting** - Ideal student
- **Slow learning, quick forgetting** - Worst case scenario

## Verse 13

**There are four types of charity givers. He who wishes to give, but that others should not give: his eye is evil to that which belongs to others; He who wishes that others should give, but that he himself should not give: his eye is evil towards that which is his own; He who desires that he himself should give, and that others should give: he is a pious man; He who desires that he himself should not give and that others too should not give: he is a wicked man.**

Four charity attitudes:
- **"I'll give, others shouldn't"** - Envious of others' wealth
- **"Others should give, I shouldn't"** - Envious of his own wealth
- **"I'll give, others should too"** - Generous spirit
- **"Nobody should give"** - Completely wicked

## Verse 14

**There are four types among those who frequent the study-house (bet midrash): He who attends but does not practice: he receives a reward for attendance. He who practices but does not attend: he receives a reward for practice. He who attends and practices: he is a pious man; He who neither attends nor practices: he is a wicked man.**

Four study-house types:
- **Attends but doesn't practice** - Gets credit for learning
- **Practices but doesn't attend** - Gets credit for doing
- **Both attends and practices** - Pious/complete person
- **Neither attends nor practices** - Wicked/disconnected person

## Verse 15

**There are four types among those who sit before the sages: a sponge, a funnel, a strainer and a sieve. A sponge, soaks up everything; A funnel, takes in at one end and lets out at the other; A strainer, which lets out the wine and retains the lees; A sieve, which lets out the coarse meal and retains the choice flour.**

Four learning styles:
- **Sponge** - Absorbs everything indiscriminately
- **Funnel** - Takes in but doesn't retain anything
- **Strainer** - Keeps the bad, loses the good
- **Sieve** - Keeps the good, filters out the bad (ideal)

## Verse 16

**All love that depends on a something, [when the] thing ceases, [the] love ceases; and [all love] that does not depend on anything, will never cease. What is an example of love that depended on a something? Such was the love of Amnon for Tamar. And what is an example of love that did not depend on anything? Such was the love of David and Jonathan.**

Conditional vs. unconditional love:
- **Conditional love** - Based on external factors (beauty, benefit, etc.)
- **Unconditional love** - Based on intrinsic worth and connection
- **Amnon and Tamar** - Lust disguised as love, ended in hatred
- **David and Jonathan** - True friendship that transcended circumstances

## Verse 17

**Every dispute that is for the sake of Heaven, will in the end endure; But one that is not for the sake of Heaven, will not endure. Which is the controversy that is for the sake of Heaven? Such was the controversy of Hillel and Shammai. And which is the controversy that is not for the sake of Heaven? Such was the controversy of Korah and all his congregation.**

Constructive vs. destructive conflict:
- **For sake of Heaven** - Seeking truth and divine will
- **Not for sake of Heaven** - Seeking personal gain or honor
- **Hillel and Shammai** - Different approaches to same goal (divine truth)
- **Korah's rebellion** - Challenging authority for personal gain

## Verse 18

**Whoever causes the multitudes to be righteous, sin will not occur on his account; And whoever causes the multitudes to sin, they do not give him the ability to repent. Moses was righteous and caused the multitudes to be righteous, [therefore] the righteousness of the multitudes is hung on him, as it is said, "He executed the Lord's righteousness and His decisions with Israel" (Deut. 33:21). Jeroboam sinned and caused the multitudes to sin, [therefore] the sin of the multitudes is hung on him, as it is said, "For the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he caused Israel to sin thereby" (I Kings 15:30).**

Leadership responsibility:
- **Leading to righteousness** - Protected from sin by merit
- **Leading to sin** - Prevented from repentance as punishment
- **Moses' example** - Positive leadership creates lasting righteousness
- **Jeroboam's example** - Negative leadership creates lasting damage

## Verse 19

**Whoever possesses these three things, he is of the disciples of Abraham, our father; and [whoever possesses] three other things, he is of the disciples of Balaam, the wicked. A good eye, a humble spirit and a moderate appetiteâ€”he is of the disciples of Abraham, our father. An evil eye, a haughty spirit and a limitless appetiteâ€”he is of the disciples of Balaam, the wicked. What is the difference between the disciples of Abraham, our father, and the disciples of Balaam, the wicked? The disciples of Abraham, our father, enjoy this world, and inherit the world to come, as it is said: "I will endow those who love me with substance, I will fill their treasuries" (Proverbs 8:21). But the disciples of Balaam, the wicked, inherit gehinnom, and descend into the nethermost pit.**

Two paths of character:
- **Abraham's disciples** - Good eye, humility, moderation
- **Balaam's disciples** - Evil eye, arrogance, unlimited appetite
- **Abraham's reward** - Success in both worlds
- **Balaam's punishment** - Destruction in both worlds

## Verse 20

**Judah ben Tema said: Be strong as a leopard, and swift as an eagle, and fleet as a gazelle, and brave as a lion, to do the will of your Father who is in heaven. He used to say: the arrogant is headed for Gehinnom and the blushing for the garden of Eden. May it be the will, O Lord our God, that your city be rebuilt speedily in our days and set our portion in the studying of your Torah.**

Animal virtues for divine service:
- **Strong as a leopard** - Determined courage
- **Swift as an eagle** - Quick response to opportunities
- **Fleet as a gazelle** - Agile in avoiding temptation
- **Brave as a lion** - Fearless in doing right
- **Contrasting destinies** - Arrogance leads to hell, modesty to paradise

## Verse 21

**He used to say: At five years of age [the study of] Scripture; At ten the [study of] Mishnah; At thirteen [subject to the] commandments; At fifteen the [study of] Talmud; At eighteen the bridal canopy; At twenty for pursuit [of livelihood]; At thirty the peak of strength; At forty wisdom; At fifty able to give counsel; At sixty old age; At seventy fullness of years; At eighty the age of "strength"; At ninety a bent body; At one hundred, as good as dead and gone completely out of the world.**

Life stages and their purposes:
- **Ages 5-15** - Foundation of learning (Scripture, Mishnah, Talmud)
- **Ages 13-20** - Transition to responsibility (commandments, marriage, work)
- **Ages 30-50** - Peak performance (strength, wisdom, counsel)
- **Ages 60-100** - Gradual decline but accumulated wisdom

## Verse 22

**Ben Bag Bag said: Turn it over, and [again] turn it over, for all is therein. And look into it; And become gray and old therein; And do not move away from it, for you have no better portion than it.**

Torah study as life's work:
- **Turn it over repeatedly** - Constant study reveals new insights
- **All is therein** - Torah contains all wisdom
- **Lifelong engagement** - Study until old age
- **No better portion** - Nothing surpasses Torah study

## Verse 23

**Ben He He said: According to the labor is the reward.**

Simple but profound truth:
- **Effort determines reward** - Divine justice is precise
- **No shortcuts** - Real achievement requires real work
- **Encouragement to persevere** - Your efforts will be rewarded

*Chapter Five emphasizes patterns in divine providence (tens and sevens), different human types and temperaments, and the importance of proper motivation in all endeavors. It concludes with the stages of life and the supreme value of Torah study.*
