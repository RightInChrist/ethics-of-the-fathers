# Ethics of the Fathers: Chapter Four

## Verse 1

**Ben Zoma would say: Who is wise? One who learns from every person, as is stated: "From all my teachers I have grown wise." Who is strong? One who overpowers his inclinations, as is stated: "Better one who is slow to anger than a strong man, and one who rules his spirit than a conqueror of a city." Who is rich? One who is satisfied with his lot, as is stated: "When you eat the toil of your hands, fortunate are you, and good is to you"—"fortunate are you" in this world, "and good is to you" in the World to Come. Who is honored? One who honors others, as is stated: "For those who honor Me, I will honor, and those who scorn Me will be degraded."**

Four fundamental questions about true success:
- **True wisdom** - Learning from everyone, not just formal teachers
- **True strength** - Self-control, mastering your own nature
- **True wealth** - Contentment with what you have
- **True honor** - Giving respect to others brings respect to yourself

## Verse 2

**Ben Azzai would say: Run to pursue a minor mitzvah, and flee from transgression. For one mitzvah leads to another mitzvah, and one transgression leads to another transgression. For the reward of a mitzvah is a mitzvah, and the reward of a transgression is a transgression.**

The momentum of choices:
- **Pursue even small good deeds** - They build positive momentum
- **Avoid any transgression** - They create negative momentum
- **Good deeds lead to more good deeds** - Virtue builds on itself
- **Bad deeds lead to more bad deeds** - Vice is habit-forming
- The reward for goodness is becoming a person who does good

## Verse 3

**He would also say: Do not scorn any person, and do not discount any thing. For there is no person who does not have his hour, and no thing that does not have its place.**

Universal respect and purpose:
- **Every person has value** - Don't look down on anyone
- **Every thing has purpose** - Nothing in creation is worthless
- **Everyone has their moment** - Each person will have their time to contribute
- **Everything has its place** - All parts of creation serve the greater whole

## Verse 4

**Rabbi Levitas of Yavneh would say: Be very, very humble, for the hope of mortal man is worms.**

Ultimate humility:
- **Extreme humility is appropriate** - We are fundamentally mortal
- **Death humbles all pretensions** - Physical decay awaits everyone
- **Remember your mortality** - Don't let temporary success create arrogance
- True greatness includes awareness of human limitation

## Verse 5

**Rabbi Yochanan ben Baroka would say: Anyone who desecrates the name of Heaven in secret will be punished in public. Regarding the desecration of the Name, it makes no difference if it was done unwittingly or deliberately.**

Public consequences of private actions:
- **Secret sins become public** - Hidden wrongdoing eventually emerges
- **Divine reputation matters** - Our actions reflect on God's name
- **Intent doesn't excuse damage** - Even unintentional desecration has consequences
- **Accountability is certain** - What's hidden from people isn't hidden from God

## Verse 6

**Rabbi Ishmael ben Rabbi Yose would say: One who learns Torah in order to teach, is given the opportunity to learn and teach. One who learns in order to practice, is given the opportunity to learn, teach, observe and practice.**

Motivation determines opportunity:
- **Learning to teach** - God provides chances to share knowledge
- **Learning to practice** - God provides comprehensive opportunities
- **Higher motivation brings greater blessing** - Intent to live the teachings opens more doors
- **Teaching and doing** - Both are necessary for complete fulfillment

## Verse 7

**Rabbi Tzadok would say: Do not separate yourself from the community. Do not act as a counselor-at-law when serving as a judge. Do not make the Torah a crown to aggrandize yourself with, nor a spade to dig with.**

Community and Torah ethics:
- **Stay connected to community** - Don't isolate yourself
- **Avoid conflicts of interest** - Don't advocate when you should judge
- **Don't use Torah for personal gain** - Neither for honor nor livelihood
- **Torah is for service** - Not for self-advancement

## Verse 8

**He would also say: Such is the way of Torah: Eat bread with salt, drink water in small measure, sleep on the ground, live a life of deprivation—but toil in Torah. If you do so, "fortunate are you, and good is to you"—"fortunate are you" in this world, "and good is to you" in the World to Come.**

The ascetic path of learning:
- **Simple living** - Basic food, minimal comfort
- **Focus on essentials** - Reduce material distractions
- **Toil in Torah** - Put energy into learning and growth
- **Dual reward** - Benefits in both this world and the next
- **True fortune** - Comes from wisdom, not wealth

## Verse 9

**Rabbi Yose would say: Whoever honors the Torah, his person is honored by the creations. Whoever degrades the Torah, his person is degraded by the creations.**

Universal response to Torah respect:
- **Honor Torah, gain honor** - Respect for wisdom brings respect
- **Degrade Torah, lose respect** - Disrespecting wisdom costs reputation
- **Creation recognizes Torah** - The world responds to how you treat divine wisdom
- **Natural consequences** - Your relationship with wisdom affects how others see you

## Verse 10

**Rabbi Ishmael ben Rabbi Yochanan ben Baroka would say: One who learns in order to teach, is given the opportunity to learn and teach. One who learns in order to practice, is given the opportunity to learn, teach, observe and practice.**

*[This appears to be a repetition of verse 6, showing the importance of this teaching]*

## Verse 11

**Rabbi Yannai would say: We do not have in our hands the tranquility of the wicked or the suffering of the righteous.**

*[This teaching also appears in Chapter 3, emphasizing its importance]*

## Verse 12

**Rabbi Yaakov would say: This world is like a lobby before the World to Come. Prepare yourself in the lobby so that you may enter the banquet hall.**

*[Also repeated from Chapter 3, showing its centrality to Jewish thought]*

## Verse 13

**He would also say: Better one hour of repentance and good deeds in this world than the entire life of the World to Come. And better one hour of bliss in the World to Come than the entire life of this world.**

*[Repeated from Chapter 3, emphasizing the value of both worlds]*

## Verse 14

**Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar would say: Do not appease your friend in his time of anger, do not console him while his dead lies before him, do not ask him about his vow at the time he makes it, and do not see him in his time of degradation.**

*[Teaching about timing, also from Chapter 3]*

## Verse 15

**Shmuel the Small would say: "When your enemy falls, do not rejoice, and when he stumbles, let your heart not be glad, lest the Lord see and be displeased, and He turn His wrath from him."**

*[Teaching about enemies, repeated from Chapter 3]*

## Verse 16

**Elisha ben Avuya would say: One who learns as a child, to what is it compared? To ink written upon fresh paper. One who learns as an elder, to what is it compared? To ink written upon erased paper.**

*[Teaching about learning at different ages, from Chapter 3]*

## Verse 17

**Rabbi Yose bar Yehudah of Kfar Habavli would say: One who learns from the young, to what is it compared? To one who eats unripe grapes and drinks wine from the vat. One who learns from the aged, to what is it compared? To one who eats ripe grapes and drinks aged wine.**

*[Teaching about learning from different ages, from Chapter 3]*

## Verse 18

**Rabbi [Yehudah HaNasi] would say: Do not look at the container, but at what is in it. There is a new flask that is full of old wine, and an old flask that does not even have new wine in it.**

*[Teaching about judging by content not appearance, from Chapter 3]*

## Verse 19

**Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah would say: Where there is no Torah, there is no proper conduct; where there is no proper conduct, there is no Torah. Where there is no wisdom, there is no fear of God; where there is no fear of God, there is no wisdom. Where there is no understanding, there is no knowledge; where there is no knowledge, there is no understanding. Where there is no flour, there is no Torah; where there is no Torah, there is no flour.**

*[Teaching about interconnectedness, from Chapter 3]*

## Verse 20

**He would also say: Anyone whose wisdom exceeds his deeds, to what is he compared? To a tree whose branches are many but whose roots are few; the wind comes and uproots it and overturns it... But anyone whose deeds exceed his wisdom, to what is he compared? To a tree whose branches are few but whose roots are many; even if all the winds of the world come and blow upon it, they cannot budge it from its place...**

*[The tree metaphor about wisdom vs. deeds, from Chapter 3]*

## Verse 21

**Rabbi Elazar Chisma would say: The laws of bird offerings and the laws of menstrual periods—these are the body of the Halakha. Astronomy and geometry are the seasonings of wisdom.**

The structure of knowledge:
- **Core religious law** - Essential halakhic knowledge
- **Scientific knowledge** - Mathematics and astronomy as enrichment
- **Both have value** - But know what's essential vs. supplementary
- **Practical wisdom first** - Master the fundamentals before the extras

## Verse 22

**He would also say: Envy, lust and [the pursuit of] honor remove a person from the world.**

Three destructive drives:
- **Envy** - Wanting what others have destroys contentment
- **Lust** - Uncontrolled desire leads to poor choices
- **Honor-seeking** - Pursuing status corrupts character
- **All remove from world** - These drives disconnect you from meaningful life

*Chapter Four emphasizes true definitions of success, the importance of proper motivation in learning, and the dangers of destructive character traits that remove us from authentic living.*
